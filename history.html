                    <h2>Stone Temple Origins</h2>
                    <p>The Stone Temple Baptist Church became an anchor for the neighborhood shortly after its construction in 1926. Its sanctuary welcomed new migrants from the South and offered mutual aid programs that eased their transition into Chicago life.</p>
                    <p>Congregants remember the early years as a blend of spirited worship, mutual support, and organizing meetings that laid the groundwork for future civil rights actions.</p>

                    <h2>Movement &amp; Momentum</h2>
                    <p>In the 1960s, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and local leaders used the temple as a base to push for fair housing. Sit-ins, food programs, and legal clinics radiated from this address, transforming the block into a hub of grassroots power.</p>
                    <p>Today’s revitalization projects still follow that example—pairing cultural memory with action to ensure new investments benefit long-time residents.</p>
