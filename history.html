                    <p>Stone Temple Missionary Baptist Church was founded in 1954 by J.M. Stone, who was a friend of
                        Martin Luther King, Sr. in Georgia.</p>
                    <p>This was the first Chicago church where Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. gave speeches during the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. It supported the Chicago Freedom Movement which focused on fair housing. King moved to Chicago in 1966. The Fair Housing Act was passed in 1968. The pulpit used by Martin Luther King, Jr. is on display as are photos of Reverends King and Stone.</p>

                    <p>The building was originally built as a Jewish Synagogue when the neighborhood population was largely Jewish. Many of the original stained glass windows and interior light fixtures are original and feature the Star of David and the menorah. Stone Temple MBC retains a connection to the Jewish community and continues to hold events which honor major Jewish holidays. </p>


                    <p>
                        The building was designated a Chicago Landmark in 2016. It was built by Joseph W. Cohen & Company Architects in 1926.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Senior Pastor, Derrick Milas Fitzpatrick, is the grandson of the founder J.M. Stone.
